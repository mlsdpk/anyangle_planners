# Algorithms for Any-angle Pathfinding

This repository contains implementations of popular 2D pathfinding algorithms from the literature, along with convenient scripts for benchmarking and visualization. The example 2D benchmark grid maps and problems are sourced from [Nathan Sturtevant's Moving AI Lab](https://www.movingai.com/).
